        sweet question!\n\nThe pH of honey can vary depending on several factors,
        such as the type of flowers the bees gather nectar from, the region where
        the honey is produced, and the processing methods used.\n\nIn general, the
        pH of honey is slightly acidic to neutral. The typical pH range for honey
        is between 3.2 and 4.5, with an average pH value around 3.9-4.0 [1]. This
        acidity comes from the presence of organic acids, such as gluconic acid, citric
        acid, and malic acid, which are naturally present in honey.\n\nFor comparison,
        here are some common substances and their pH levels:\n\n* Lemon juice: pH
        2.0\n* Vinegar: pH 2.4\n* Orange juice: pH 3.5\n* Water: pH 7.0 (neutral)\n*
        Milk: pH 6.5-7.0\n\nSo, honey is generally more acidic than water and milk,
        but less acidic than lemon juice or vinegar.\n\nIt''s worth noting that some
        types of honey, such as Manuka honey from New Zealand, may have a slightly
        higher pH due to the presence of certain compounds like methylglyoxal [2].\n\nOverall,
        the pH of honey is an important factor in its quality and stability, as it
        can affect the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1]
