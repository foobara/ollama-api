        sweet question!\n\nThe pH of honey can vary depending on several factors,
        such as the type of flowers the bees collect nectar from, the soil quality,
        and the processing methods used. However, in general, honey has a relatively
        low pH level.\n\nHere are some typical pH ranges for different types of honey:\n\n*
        Raw honey: 3.2 to 4.5 (slightly acidic)\n* Processed honey: 4.0 to 6.0 (neutral
        to slightly alkaline)\n* Manuka honey: 3.5 to 4.5 (slightly acidic)\n\nFor
        comparison, the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with:\n\n* Acidic values below
        7\n* Neutral values around 7 (like pure water)\n* Alkaline values above 7\n\nHoney''s
        acidity comes from the presence of compounds like gluconic acid and other
        organic acids, which are formed during the ripening process in the honeycomb.
        These acids help to preserve the honey and prevent spoilage.\n\nIt''s worth
        noting that some types of honey, such as Manuka honey, have a slightly higher
        pH level due to the unique composition of their nectar source."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":59172944116,"load_duration":5341590273,"prompt_eval_count":17,"prompt_eval_duration":1141000000,"eval_count":244,"eval_duration":52686000000}'
