        typically has a pH range of **3.2 to 4.5**, making it mildly acidic. Most
        honey falls around **pH 3.5 to 3.9**.\n\nThis acidity is due to:\n- Natural
        organic acids like gluconic acid (produced by bees)\n- The presence of various
        organic compounds\n- The natural fermentation process that occurs during honey
        production\n\nThe exact pH can vary slightly depending on:\n- The floral source
        of the nectar\n- Geographic location\n- Processing methods\n- Age of the honey\n\nThis
        mild acidity is one reason why honey has natural antimicrobial properties
        and helps preserve food."},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":20609812746,"load_duration":19113691915,"prompt_eval_count":15,"prompt_eval_duration":483809540,"eval_count":132,"eval_duration":1010154697}'
